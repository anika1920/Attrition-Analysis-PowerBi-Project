# Employee Attrition Analysis ðŸ“Š

Here is my project on Employee Attrition !ðŸŒŸ Using data from Kaggle, I navigated through workforce insights with the help of Power BI.

**Project Workflow:**

1. **Data Import, Cleaning, and Transformation:**
   - Ensured data integrity through thorough import and cleaning processes.

2. **Data Modeling:**
   - Constructed a robust data model to facilitate meaningful insights.

3. **DAX Measures for Necessary Metrics:**
   - Implemented Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) measures to calculate key metrics essential for attrition analysis.

4. **Creating a Power BI Report:**
   - Developed an interactive and visually appealing Power BI report.

5. **Implementing Row-Level Security (RLS):**
   - Ensured data security and confidentiality through the implementation of Row-Level Security.

6. **Publishing the Report in the Workspace with Allowed Access:**
   - Shared the report in the designated workspace with controlled access permissions.

**Key Insights:**

1. *Attrition Rate:* Identified a concerning attrition rate of 16.12%, highlighting the necessity for proactive retention strategies.

2. *Sales Representatives:* Noted sales representatives as the group experiencing the highest attrition rate.

3. *Employee Tenure:* Discovered an inverse relationship between employee tenure and attrition rate, indicating that as the number of years spent at the company increases, attrition tends to decrease.

4. *Income Range:* Found that the lowest income range corresponds to the highest incidence of attrition.
