# Employee Attrition Analysis ðŸ“Š

Here is my project on Employee Attrition !ðŸŒŸ Using data from Kaggle, I navigated through workforce insights with the help of Power BI.

**Overview**
This project explores employee data to provide a thorough understanding of factors influencing attrition in the workplace. We're digging into why employees leave their roles by analyzing details like job roles, tenure, and income ranges. Using Power BI for insightful visualizations, we aim to identify trends that can inform strategic decisions, ultimately contributing to enhancing overall employee satisfaction and retention.

**Software needed **
- Excel
- Power BI Desktop

**Project Workflow:**

   1. *Data Import, Cleaning, and Transformation*
   2. *Data Modeling*
   3. *DAX Measures for Necessary Metrics*
   4. *Creating a Power BI Report*
   5. *Implementing Row-Level Security (RLS)*
   6. *Publishing the Report in the Workspace with Allowed Access*

**Key Insights:**

1. *Attrition Rate:* Identified a concerning attrition rate of 16.12%, highlighting the necessity for proactive retention strategies.

2. *Sales Representatives:* Noted sales representatives as the group experiencing the highest attrition rate.

3. *Employee Tenure:* Discovered an inverse relationship between employee tenure and attrition rate, indicating that as the number of years spent at the company increases, attrition tends to decrease.

4. *Income Range:* Found that the lowest income range corresponds to the highest incidence of attrition.
